# Zoltar Speaks

Inspired by [this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6RK4479XD8) of movie Big(1988). Built with React.js and REST API.

## How to Play

- On the landing page, make a wish, or ask Zoltar a question (e.g. "Should I have burrito or pizza for dinner?"). 
- Cick the coin slot to insert a coin.
- Guide your coin through the Zoltar machine using keyboard arrow keys, or D-pad (only shown on touchscreens). 
  - Spiral: spins the gameboard.
  - Double arrows: reverses control. Up -> down, left -> right, vice versa.
  - Mushroom: grows the coin to super big.
  - Black holes: teleport the coin to somewhere else.
- Once you reach the exit (a golden crystall ball around the bottom right), a card would appear. Click on the card to read Zoltar's response.
